# Textbook Of Fluid Dynamics by Frank Chorlton: A Comprehensive and Accessible Introduction to Fluid Mechanics
 
Fluid dynamics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them. It has applications in many fields, such as engineering, geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, astrophysics, and biology.

In this section, we will briefly summarize the main topics covered in the remaining chapters of the book.
 
- Chapter 4: Potential Flow. This chapter introduces the concept of irrotational flow and its relation to the velocity potential and the stream function. It also discusses some important applications of potential flow theory, such as the superposition of elementary flows, the method of images, the flow past a circular cylinder, and the Kutta-Joukowski theorem.
- Chapter 5: Viscous Flow. This chapter deals with the effects of viscosity on fluid motion and the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. It also explores some solutions of these equations for simple cases, such as the Couette flow, the Poiseuille flow, and the Stokes flow.
- Chapter 6: Boundary Layers. This chapter explains the concept of boundary layer and its importance for high Reynolds number flows. It also presents some methods for analyzing boundary layer flows, such as the Blasius solution, the von Karman momentum integral equation, and the similarity transformation.
- Chapter 7: Turbulence. This chapter introduces the phenomenon of turbulence and its characteristics, such as randomness, vorticity, energy cascade, and Kolmogorov scales. It also discusses some models and methods for studying turbulent flows, such as the Reynolds decomposition, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the eddy viscosity concept.
- Chapter 8: Compressible Flow. This chapter extends the fluid dynamics theory to include the effects of density variation due to pressure and temperature changes. It also covers some topics related to compressible flow, such as the speed of sound, the Mach number, the isentropic flow relations, the normal and oblique shock waves, and the Prandtl-Meyer expansion.
- Chapter 9: Aerodynamics. This chapter applies the fluid dynamics principles to analyze the flow around airfoils and wings. It also covers some topics related to aerodynamics, such as the lift and drag forces, the circulation and lift theorem, the thin airfoil theory, and the finite wing theory.

By reading this book, you will gain a solid understanding of fluid dynamics and its applications in various fields. You will also develop your analytical and problem-solving skills by working on the exercises and problems provided in each chapter.
 
We hope you find this book helpful and enjoyable.
