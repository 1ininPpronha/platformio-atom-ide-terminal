Dire Straits were one of the most successful and influential rock bands of the late 1970s and 1980s, led by the legendary guitarist and songwriter Mark Knopfler. Their music blended blues, rock, folk, and country influences, creating a distinctive sound that appealed to millions of fans worldwide. Their debut album, Dire Straits, released in 1978, featured their breakthrough hit "Sultans of Swing", a song that showcased Knopfler's virtuosic guitar playing and witty lyrics. The song became a classic rock radio staple and remains one of their most popular songs to this day.
